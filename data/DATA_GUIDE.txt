The columns in the data files are organized in the following order:

Subject number

Total candy earned
Image filename of chosen option
Top-left (response 0) reward value

In the raw files the top line records the date and time the experiment was opened,
and the bottom line records the date and time the experiment was closed.

the image filename was recorded incorrectly. Affected data files include participants with
subjects numbers 4444-4447 and 62051-62075.
