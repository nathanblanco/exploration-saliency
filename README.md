# exploration-saliency

This repository contains various code involved in a study of the development of 
exploratory decision-making and the role that attentional processes via perceptual 
salience/novelty plays. This includes the experiment code used to run the experiment,
R code used to analyze the data, and code used to fit and evaluate Reinforcement Learning
and other computational models to the data. This study was published and can be found as:
